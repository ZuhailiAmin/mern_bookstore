# Bookstore Application

Hi everyone! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Bookstore Application, a project where I explored the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node) to create a full-stack application.

## Key Learning Points

In the course of building this application, I gained valuable insights into several important concepts:

- **CRUD with Backend**: Implementing Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the server-side.
- **Router**: Managing different routes and navigation in the application.
- **CORS Policy**: Understanding and handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for secure communication.
- **MongoDB**: Interacting with a NoSQL database to store and retrieve data efficiently.
- **CRUD with Frontend**: Building a user-friendly interface to perform CRUD operations on the client-side.

## Features

This application allows users to:

- View a list of books
- Create a new book entry
- Edit existing book details
- Delete a book from the list

## Application Demo



## Testing and Verification

To ensure the reliability of the application, I utilized Postman to test the API endpoints. This involved confirming that data was sent and received accurately, providing a comprehensive verification of the functionality and performance of the implemented features.

Feel free to explore the code and contribute to the project! ðŸš€
